Our Churches, Our Strength is an open repository for Haitian churches around the world.

Haitian churches occupy a very important place in the individual and family lives. This is the first place someone will go to look for spiritual nourishment, to make lifetime friends and to serve one's community. Various faith-based institutions are the pillar of their neighborhood as they tend to know their constituent, near and not so near overtime and often dom't easily change location.
